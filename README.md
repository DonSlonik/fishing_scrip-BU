A simple script to automatically catch fish in Bless Unleashed for PC.

The script does not modify or read game files.
The logic is built only on screenshots of your monitor and on keyboard and mouse emulation.
Because of this, the script is very dependent on your monitor size and color depth.

1. Warning
Fishing in the game will not bring any strong benefits to the player. The main goal of creating this script is to learn the Python language. Remember for using third-party programs for the game, you can be punished according to the rules of the game. Use this script at your own risk.
